# Introduction

Sushi Commerce is a powerful static e-commerce website generator built on some of the latest, extremely fast [open source technologies](/open-source/ "List of open source technolgies used in Sushi Commerce").

## The problem

Creating an e-commerce site using a popular service like Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, Big Commerce, etc. is usually overkill for new businesses and can get expensive until you start making money.

Most of the awesome features that these services offer are uneccessary when you're first starting out and all you need is a pretty website, simple way to accecpt payments, get a customer's shipping address and rank high in Google searches.
