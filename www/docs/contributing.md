# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Right now the project is maintained by [Sean W. Lawrence](http://swl.netlify.com "Sean W. Lawrence official website") (myself).

## How to contribute

The best way to contribute is to [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanWLawrence/sushi-commerce/issues/new "Raise an issue on Sushi Commerce GitHub repo") if you have any questions, suggestions or want to help on one of the refactors and/or features on our [roadmap](/roadmap/ "Sushi Commerce Roadmap")!

## Guidelines

Sushi Commerce has ES Lint, Prettier and Flow.js preconfigured to ensure styling is consistent across the codebase. New code submissions are required to have tests before getting merged (unless it's something really small or only affects the styling) and you can always [fork the repo](https://github.com/seanwlawrence/sushi-commerce "Sushi Commerce GitHub repo") on GitHub and update it yourself if you just need some edge case feature that wouldn't benefit others.
